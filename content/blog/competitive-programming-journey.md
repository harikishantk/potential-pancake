# A Rookie's View on Competitive Programming

As someone who started competitive programming not too long ago, I want to share my perspective on getting started and what I've learned along the way.

## Why Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming isn't just about winning contests. It's about:

- **Sharpening problem-solving skills**
- **Learning efficient algorithms and data structures**
- **Improving code optimization abilities**
- **Building a strong foundation for technical interviews**

## Getting Started

### Choose Your Platform

There are many platforms to practice:

1. **Codeforces** - Great for contests and rating system
2. **LeetCode** - Perfect for interview preparation
3. **HackerRank** - Good for learning with structured tracks
4. **CodeChef** - Monthly long challenges

### Pick a Language

I recommend starting with one of these:

```
Python  - Easy to write, great for prototyping
C++     - Fast execution, STL is powerful
Java    - Good for structured code
```

For competitive programming, **C++** is often preferred due to its speed and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## My Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basics (Month 1-2)

Focus on fundamental data structures:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Maps and Sets

### Phase 2: Algorithms (Month 3-4)

Learn essential algorithms:

- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Binary Search
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Month 5+)

Dive deeper into:

- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Greedy Algorithms

## Tips for Beginners

> "The key to getting good at competitive programming is consistent practice, not sporadic bursts of activity."

1. **Solve problems daily** - Even one problem a day adds up
2. **Read editorials** - Learn from others' solutions
3. **Upsolve** - Try problems you couldn't solve during contests
4. **Learn from mistakes** - Keep a notebook of common errors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Jumping to hard problems too quickly
- Not reading the problem statement carefully
- Ignoring edge cases
- Giving up too early on a problem

## Resources I Found Helpful

| Resource | Type | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| CP Algorithms | Website | Algorithm explanations |
| Codeforces Blog | Community | Tips and tricks |
| CSES Problem Set | Practice | Curated problems |
| YouTube (Errichto) | Videos | Visual explanations |

## Conclusion

Competitive programming is a marathon, not a sprint. Start with the basics, practice consistently, and don't be discouraged by initial failures. Every expert was once a beginner!

Happy coding! 🚀
